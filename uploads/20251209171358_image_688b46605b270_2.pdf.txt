ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR) MODIFIED WESTERGREN 10 mm / hr
Bio. Ref. Interval. :-
Male : 0-15 Female : 0-20
Clinical Significance:
- An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can rise if you have inflammation in your
body. Its also used as a marker to monitor prognosis of an existing inflammatory/infective condition.
- Inflammation is your immune systems response to injury, infection, and many types of conditions,
including immune system disorders, certain cancers and blood disorders.
- A high ESR test result may be from a condition that causes inflammation, such as: Arteritis, Arthritis,
Systemic vasculitis, Polymyalgia rheumatica, Inflammatory bowel disease, Kidney disease, Infections like
Tuberculosis etc, Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, Heart disease, Certain cancers and
many other Conditions.
- A low ESR test result may be caused by conditions such as: A blood disorder, such as: Polycythemia, Sickle
cell disease (SCD), Leukocytosis, Heart failure, Certain kidney and liver problems etc.
- Certain physiological conditions also affect ESR results, these include : Pregnancy, menstrual cycle,
ageing, obesity, drinking alcohol regularly, and exercise, Certain medicines and supplements also can
affect ESR results.
- Hence Its always suggested to interpret ESR results in conjunction with Clinical History and other
findings.

Clinical Significance:
CA-125 is used to monitor therapy during treatment for Ovarian Cancer. CA125 is also to detect or monitor whether there is a
recurrence of cancer or malignancy after surgical removal of tumor or radiation therapy or chemotherapy (antineoplastic drugs).
This test is sometimes used to follow High-Risk women who have a family history of Ovarian Cancer. CA-125 may normally be
increased in early pregnancy and during menstruation. It can also be increased in diseases such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
or Endometriosis and sometimes in Hepatitis and Cirrhosis of the liver.

Clinical Significance:
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that has been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorous; both are
critical for building bone health.
Decrease in vitamin D total levels indicate inadequate exposure of sunlight, dietary deficiency, nephrotic syndrome.
Increase in vitamin D total levels indicate Vitamin D intoxication.

VITAMIN B-12 E.C.L.I.A < 100 pg/mL
Bio. Ref. Interval. :-
Normal: 197-771 pg/ml
Clinical significance :
Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin, is a complex corrinoid compound found exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat,
eggs and milk. It is critical in normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation and in the formation of myelin
sheath. Vitamin-B12 is used to find out neurological abnormalities and impaired DNA synthesis associated with macrocytic
anemias. For diagnostic purpose, results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patients medical history, clinical
examination and other findings.

Bio. Ref. Interval. :-
Normal : < 4.00 ng/ml
Border line : 4.01 to 10.00 ng/ml
Clinical Significance:
Elevated levels of PSA are associated with prostate cancer, but may also be seen with prostatitis (Inflammation of the prostate)
and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PSA test done along with free PSA provides additional information. Studies have
suggested that the percentage of free PSA in total PSA is lower in patients with prostate cancer than those with benign prostate
hyperplasia.

EST. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (eGFR) CALCULATED 125 mL/min/1.73 m2
Bio. Ref. Interval. :-
> = 90 : Normal
60 - 89 : Mild Decrease
45 - 59 : Mild to Moderate Decrease
30 - 44 : Moderate to Severe Decrease
15 - 29 : Severe Decrease
Clinical Significance
The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild and
moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely
estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value
when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in
clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to
interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the
percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal
medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.
